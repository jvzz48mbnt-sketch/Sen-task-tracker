SDLC Report: Simple Task Tracker
1. Planning & Requirements Analysis
Objective: To develop a simple, mobile-responsive Task Tracker application.
User Requirements:
• The user must be able to input a task name.
• The user must be able to add the task to a visible list.
• The system should notify the user if they try to add an empty task.
2. System Design (Nomenclatures)
During this phase, specific naming conventions were established to ensure consistency between the design and the final code. These names are used globally across the project files:
• File Nomenclatures: index.html, style.css, and script.js.
• Variable/ID Nomenclatures:
• taskInput: The text input field for the user.
• addTaskBtn: The button used to trigger the addition of a task.
• taskList: The unordered list (<ul>) where tasks are displayed.
• Function Nomenclature:
• addNewTask(): The main JavaScript function that handles the logic.
3. Implementation
The implementation phase involved translating the design into code.
• HTML: Developed the structure using the taskInput and taskList IDs.
• CSS: Applied styles to ensure the taskList items are visually distinct.
• JavaScript: Wrote the addNewTask() function to capture user input and update the Document Object Model (DOM).
4. Testing
We performed manual testing to verify the requirements:
1. Positive Test: Entered "Study for Exams" and clicked the addTaskBtn. The task was successfully appended to the taskList.
2. Validation Test: Left the taskInput blank and clicked the button. A browser alert appeared as expected, preventing an empty entry.
5. Deployment & Maintenance
The project was deployed via GitHub. Version control was managed using Git, ensuring that the code is publicly accessible and can be maintained through future updates
